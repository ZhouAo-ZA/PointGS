# PointGS

In this work, we make a first attempt to develop a synergistic framework, called PointGS. Leveraging both the strength of geometric structure and semantic representation, PointGS establishes a mutual supervision mechanism that can bridge the two spaces and fuse complementary information for better analyzing 3D point cloud data. Compared with existing popular networks, our work attains obvious performance improvement on all three mainstream tasks without any sophisticated operations.
